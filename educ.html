I am Stefanie Alcazar, 22 years old, dreaming of finishing college and becoming a full-fledged teacher in the coming years. With the help of Tanauan City College, I was able to continue my studies. This institution has been a great support for someone like me who doesn’t earn enough daily but holds big dreams. Tanauan City College has been my partner in life for several years, witnessing my quirks, cheerfulness, sadness, fears, and hopes.
Tanauan City College does not discriminate—whether rich or poor, they are ready to help. It also doesn’t limit by age; whether young or old, they extend their assistance. As a scholar of Tanauan City College, the support it provided not only helped me as a student but also made a big difference for my parents.
